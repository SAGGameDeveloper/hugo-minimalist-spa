<p>A minimalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single page application</a> theme for <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a>
(minimum 0.43).</p>

<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>Hugo does not support single page applications natively, so making a theme that does is quite a challenge. This is the main reason I decided to make this theme.</p>

<p>This theme was created using <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.48">Hugo 0.48</a>,
and it should work from <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.43">0.43</a> onward. Still, it could give some trouble with versions below 0.48,
so be aware of it if you use older versions. You can always open an
issue if you are unable to make it work, I will be glad to help and
make the necessary enhancements.</p>

<p>You can see a working website example using this theme <a href="https://saggamedeveloper.github.io/Cafe-website-SPA/">here</a>.</p>
